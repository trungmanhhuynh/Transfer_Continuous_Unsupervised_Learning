    "**What's interesting ?** - Train a network using all domains (datasets) and fine-tune the network by using drop-out methods for each datasets. The paper shows that instead of using random dropout, the deterministic dropout, stoschatic dropout, and the combination of these two improve the accuracy of each dataset significantly. The dropout only acts on the near last layer of the network. \n",

    "**Deterministic Dropout:** Each neuron is assign a impact score based on its contribution to the lost reduction. That's said, the more loss is reduced by disable a neuron, the more contribution it is. The impact score is calculated as: \n",
