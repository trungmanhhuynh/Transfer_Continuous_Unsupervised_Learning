# Summary 
**Continous/Continual/Incremental Learning**

A truly incremental deep learning approach for classification (Castro2018 et al) is characterized by its:
 - ability to being trained from a flow of data, with classes appearing in any order, and at any time 
 - good performance on classifying old and new classes.
 - reasonable number of parameters and memory requirements for the model.
